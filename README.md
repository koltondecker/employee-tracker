## Description: 
Companies need a way to organize their employees and the structure of the company personnel. With the Employee Tracker application, you are able to follow the CRUD sytem to interact with a backend database for storing information for your company employee structure. You are given options to create employees, roles, and departments. You are then able to simply read information within each of those, update that information or delete line items.
